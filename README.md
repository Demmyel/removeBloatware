# removeBloatware
Removes various Microsoft and HP bloatware.

# Motivation
2015 was the previous year, we ( company ) upgraded all our notebooks and PCs. 2020 we decided to buy a bunch ( ~50 ) new Notebooks, which we manually installed and configured. Not gonna lie, it was a pain.. So after that experience I've made a script that does all the configuring automatically and the .ps1 file is only a small part of the whole script.

Feel free to use it for your own purposes.
